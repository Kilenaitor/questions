# FizzBuzz
## Instructions
1. Write a program that will print out the numbers from 1 to 100. But, for each number that is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz". For each number that is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz". For each number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
2. Output should be on a single line, with spaces in between each entry e.g. 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz etc.
3. Case does not matter (Fizz vs fizz) but FizzBuzz is a single word (FizzBuzz Fizzbuzz fizzbuzz are all valid)
4. Save the output to a single string and have the method return the entire string.
5. Good luck! :D
