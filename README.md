# Programming Sample Questions
## Document Structure
Each directory has a problem description and an empty file for you to fill in your code.
You are not required to use this file, as it will be in C++, but it will have the skeleton structure of the problem setup.
## Instructions
Fork this repository.

Submit a pull request on the `people` directory of just a file of your GitHub username (just a simple `touch <filename>`).
This will be used for testing your code to see if your solution works. :)

If your code doesn't work on the first try, don't worry! Not like this is a grade or anything.
## Grading
Grading is automated. I'll do a git pull on your forked repository (using the username you post in the people directory).
A Python script will be used for comparing your code's output to the expected output.
