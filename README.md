# Programming Sample Questions
## Document Structure
Each directory has a problem description and an empty file for you to fill in your code.
You must use this file and keep the name as-is. You may add additional/helper methods so long as you do not
change the included method name or the parameters passed to it.
## Instructions
Fork this repository.

Submit a pull request on the `people` directory of just a file with the name of your GitHub username (just a simple `touch <username>`).
This will be used for testing your code to see if your solution works.

If your code doesn't work on the first try, don't worry! Not like this is a grade or anything.
## Grading
Grading is automated using C++ unit tests.

Your repo will be cloned using an automated script, and each function will 
be included in a cpp file that will run your function and compare its output
to the expected result. Evaluations are pass/fail and you wont see the 
specific cases that will be run â€“ so be careful!
